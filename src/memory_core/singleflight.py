"""Single-flight execution of identical concurrent calls.

When several threads ask for the same key at once, the first runs the
function and the others wait for its result instead of repeating the work.
A waiter that is not answered within `timeout` seconds, or whose leader
failed, runs the function itself, so a slow or broken leader never turns
into an error or an unbounded wait for anyone else.
