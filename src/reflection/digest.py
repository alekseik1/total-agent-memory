        Find and merge semantic duplicates in knowledge table.
        Uses content similarity (SequenceMatcher).
        Returns number of merged records.

        Before paying for the O(len_a * len_b) SequenceMatcher.ratio() call,
        each pair is screened with real_quick_ratio()/quick_ratio(). Both are
        documented, mathematically proven upper bounds on ratio() (ratio() <=
        quick_ratio() <= real_quick_ratio()), and unlike ratio() itself they
        are symmetric in argument order (verified empirically: swapping a/b
        never changes their value, while it CAN change ratio() itself). That
        means the cheap bounds can safely be computed in whatever order is
        fastest to cache, while the actual ratio() call below is kept in the
        exact original argument order (content_a, content_b) so its numeric
        result -- and therefore which pairs cross `threshold` -- is unchanged.

        The cheap-bound matcher fixes group_rows[i]'s content as seq2 (`b`)
        for the whole inner loop and only swaps seq1 (`a`) per candidate j,
        per the stdlib's own guidance for comparing one sequence against
        many: this reuses the cached per-b state (fullbcount/b2j) instead of
        rebuilding it on every pair.
