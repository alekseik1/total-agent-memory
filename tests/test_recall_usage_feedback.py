"""`recall_count` is a usage statistic, not a ranking signal.

`Recall.search` bumps `recall_count` on every row it returns. Until 14.4.0 the
scorer also added `min(0.3, recall_count * 0.05)`, so rows that merely showed
up often (short turns matching a common name) outranked the ones that answered
the question: on LoCoMo an agent's own queries cost 4.7 points of R@10 within
one pass. Counting stays (dashboard, consolidation); ranking ignores it.
Benchmarks and `memory_explain_search` pass `record_usage=False` so their runs
leave no trace in the statistics.
